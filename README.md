A consideration of the use of XGBoost as a replacement technique for imputation
of missing values in official statistics. 

## Background

This work was originally undertaken as part of a Data Science Academy project. A
scheme internal to the UK's Office for National Statistics to allow its staff to
do short (2 weeks) projects into machine learning techniques applied into domains
which are known to the mentee supervised by members of @datasciencecampus.

This project was created for @Vinayak-NZ.


## Contents 

Techniques compared include:

* XGBoost
* CANCEIS
* RBEIS
* Mixed methods

Future work is currently ongoing outside of this repository for other 
approaches which includes multiple imputation and a consideration of the use of
more sophisticated techniques (e.g. autoencoders). 


There is also an alternate workstream considering the use of genetic algorithms
for this type of work. This is an Academy project for a separate member of the
imputation methodology team. 

Future plans include a methodological consideration of the suitability of these
techniques in practice and to provide a more abstract consideration of what the 
most suitable mechanisms for this would be.

The project write up is available on the `gh-pages` branch and there is the 
presentation given after completion of the work on the `presentation` branch.
